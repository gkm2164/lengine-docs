You should install [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org) on your machine.

First, clone this repo and install the dependencies required:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gkm2164/lengine
```

Then, build lengine parser/compilers

```bash
$ cd lengine
$ ./install.sh
```

Now, you're ready to write a code.
